ofxTransparentWindow
====================

Make your openFrameworks window transparent

**OSX only!**

Addon originally created by [Akira Hayasaka](http://www.ampontang.com/) and [posted in the oF forum](http://forum.openframeworks.cc/index.php?topic=4811.0).

## warning
It doesn't appear to work with 0.8.0.  Posting back in the forum to see if I can get some help...
